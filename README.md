Workshop 3 task
## Change made during coding

### Problems met
* When I tried to draw an image on the canvas, the preview shows that it is loading - then I found out that I wrote 'image = loadImage...' instead of 'img = loadImage...'.

```
img = loadImage('images/Sleeping cat.jpg');
```
* I tried to move the image to the center of the canvas, but an extre image was created - Two draw functions for the image, after I delete one of it, it becomes normal.
