Workshop 3 task
## Change made during coding

### Problems met
* When I tried to draw an image on the canvas, the preview shows that it is loading - then I found out that I wrote 'image = loadImage...' instead of 'img = loadImage...'.
<img width="1135" alt="截屏2025-01-19 22 27 27" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9efe61c8-e459-4759-9a49-bfbcae624399" />
```
img = loadImage('images/Sleeping cat.jpg');
```
