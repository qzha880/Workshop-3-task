Workshop 3 task
## Change made during coding
* I want to make the shapes bigger nerar the edges and smaller shapes for the cat (center) to make the image more clear.
* *I created different shapes, different sizes
* 
### Problems met
* When I tried to draw an image on the canvas, the preview shows that it is loading - then I found out that I wrote 'image = loadImage...' instead of 'img = loadImage...'.

* When I moved the image to the center of the canvas, but an extre image was created - Two draw functions for the image, after I delete one of it, it becomes normal.
